This is project was done by me and my friend iyed 
we are both begginers and we are doing  this project after one month of learning js and a week with html and css so 
do not expect much  
we set a time limit to finish this project '48hours' and its was really hard we had no idea what is jquery how js and html interacts with each other 
and i think for starters with chose a long project but we managed to finish it on time 

i sat with iyed we were thinking  what is something that we both love geography came up 

We agreed on make a site with (three games / a login page/a main page/a page to reach us)
the three games :
1-flag games 
2-select the capital on a map
3- mountains of el kef(this was a bit special because we wanted to add something uniquely ours so we chose to make a guessing game on the mounatains of our home el kef)
